Hello again,

A new version of the Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio
subroutine library is available. For more information on cfitsio, see
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio

The only change in this version is a bug fixed from 1.04 whereby Perl
multidimensional arrays returned from fits_read_pix and fits_read_pixnull 
had their dimensions reversed.

Version 3.006 of the cfitsio library is required to build this
module. Astro::FITS::CFITSIO has been tested on Linux 2.6 (ix86, Perl
5.8.3) and Solaris 2.8 (Sparc, Perl 5.005).

This version of Astro::FITS::CFITSIO can be obtained at
  http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~rpete/cfitsio/Astro-FITS-CFITSIO-1.05.tar.gz

And also on your local CPAN mirror
  http://cpan.org/authors/id/P/PR/PRATZLAFF/Astro-FITS-CFITSIO-1.05.tar.gz

As always, you can find the latest version of Astro::FITS::CFITSIO at
