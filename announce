Hello again,

A new version of the Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio
subroutine library is available. For more information on the cfitsio
subroutine library, see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio

The module name has changed from CFITSIO to Astro::FITS::CFITSIO.
A final version of the old module is also being made available
for the transition period - it simply aliases the CFITSIO symbol table
to Astro::FITS::CFITSIO, and warns that the module has been replaced.

New features in Astro::FITS::CFITSIO 1.00 include:

* Added new cfitsio 2.300 and 2.400 routines:
  fits_compress_heap
  fits_test_heap
  fits_compress_img
  fits_decompress_img
  fits_get_compression_type
  fits_set_compression_type
  fits_get_noise_bits
  fits_set_noise_bits
  fits_get_tile_dim
  fits_set_tile_dim
  fits_write_subset
  constants GZIP_1, PLIO_1 and RICE_1

You will need at least version 2.400 of the cfitsio library in order to
build this module. Astro::FITS::CFITSIO has been tested on Linux (2.2.x,
ix86, glibc 2.1) and Solaris 2.6 with perl 5.6.0 and perl 5.005,
respectively.
